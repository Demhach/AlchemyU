The generateAdress file in the Scripts folder was used to generate publicKeys, privateKeys, Signatures and Adresses to emulate the apps use by real people. 
I created 3 personas kenny, al, and dan and each of them has their data represented by an object. 

For this project, I found using the Eth-crypto library to be much more convenient, link: https://github.com/pubkey/eth-crypto#recoverpublickey
